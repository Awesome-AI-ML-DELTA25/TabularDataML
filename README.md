# To Do
- Create a conda environment to store the packages
- Unzip the data (use !unzip on terminal or use python package zipfile)
- Load the data into a pandas dataframe
- Use previously cleaned data: You can use the cleaned data from the previous project (pick anyone's work you want to)
- Perform a test train split
- Use your favourite model to perform regression and get predictions on train data
- Report appropriate metrics
- Choose good hyperparameters
- Ensure best practices
- Work solo or in pairs
- Ensure that your code is well commented
- Create a jupyter notebook to document your work
- Create a README file to explain your project, your process, and your findings
- Create a requirements.txt file to document the packages you used
- Create a .gitignore file to ignore the data files
- Create a branch for your project on this repository

The best project will be merged into the main branch for showcase! Good luck!
